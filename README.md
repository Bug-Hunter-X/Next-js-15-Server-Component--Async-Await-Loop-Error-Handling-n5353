# Next.js 15 Server Component: Async/Await Loop Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Next.js 15 server components when using `async/await` within a loop.  If an error occurs during one iteration, the loop might not stop gracefully, leading to unexpected behavior or silent failures. The provided solution shows how to properly handle these errors.

## Bug

The bug lies in the improper handling of errors within an async/await loop in a server component.  A rejected promise within the loop is not handled effectively, leading to a partial result instead of complete error propagation. 

## Solution

The solution involves either breaking the loop using `break` or throwing an aggregated error to halt the loop execution and properly handle the error scenario.
